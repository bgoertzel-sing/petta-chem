# exp02 small random-polymer sweep — 2026-06-30/2026-07-01

## Purpose

First small deterministic exp02 plumbing/control sweep. This is not an emergence claim; it verifies that random-polymer, shuffled-catalyst, and no-catalysis runs can be represented in PeTTa and recorded under the v0.1 run-contract shape across multiple seed/rule-count points, including component-generated, planted seed-to-component, and generated non-planted eight-rule families.

## Commands

From repository root:

```bash
scripts/run_exp02.sh
```

## Seed list

- `seed-7` / four rules

- `exp02-seed-11-rules-6-shuffled`: seed-11/six-rule shuffled-catalyst control, active ACS pairs = 0.

- `exp02-seed-13-rules-8-no-catalysis`: seed-13/eight-rule no-catalysis control, active ACS pairs = 0.
- `exp02-seed-17-rules-8-random`: seed-17/eight-rule seed-to-component random-polymer family, active ACS pairs = 2.

## Sweep-kind active-pair summary

PeTTa `exp02-sweep-kind-summary` atoms now separate planted reciprocal-pair controls from generated-unplanted controls: planted controls have 4/12 family records with active pairs and 7 total active pairs across four random-polymer points; generated-unplanted controls have 0/6 family records with active pairs and 0 total active pairs across seed-19 and seed-23.

## Exit status

- `scripts/run_exp02.sh`: `0`

## Conclusion

The small exp02 sweep passed across seed-7/four-rule, seed-11/six-rule, component-generated seed-13/eight-rule, seed-to-component planted seed-17/eight-rule, and seed-to-component non-planted seed-19/seed-23 eight-rule parameter points. The planted seed-derived polymer fixtures contain conservative reciprocal product-as-catalyst pairs, while shuffled-catalyst, no-catalysis, and the generated seed-19 and seed-23 non-planted random-polymer controls contain zero active ACS pairs. This validates broader exp02 control/run-record plumbing only; larger less-fixture-like sweeps are still needed before making any spontaneous-ACS claim.
## Serialized run-contract files

After the PeTTa smoke passed, `scripts/write_exp02_contract_files.sh` serializes all eighteen tested run-contract records into per-run directories:

- `runs/exp02-small-random/`
- `runs/exp02-small-shuffled/`
- `runs/exp02-small-no-catalysis/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-11-rules-6-random/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-11-rules-6-shuffled/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-11-rules-6-no-catalysis/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-13-rules-8-random/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-13-rules-8-shuffled/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-13-rules-8-no-catalysis/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-17-rules-8-random/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-17-rules-8-shuffled/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-17-rules-8-no-catalysis/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-19-rules-8-random/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-19-rules-8-shuffled/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-19-rules-8-no-catalysis/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-23-rules-8-random/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-23-rules-8-shuffled/`
- `runs/exp02-seed-23-rules-8-no-catalysis/`

Each directory follows the v0.1 file convention: `CONFIG.metta`, `MANIFEST.metta`, `EVENTS.metta`, `ABUNDANCES.metta`, `METRICS.metta`, `ACS.metta`, `ABLATIONS.metta`, and `SUMMARY.metta`. The host script only serializes atoms already represented/tested in PeTTa; chemistry and ACS detection remain in `.metta` files.
