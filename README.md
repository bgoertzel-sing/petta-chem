# petta-chem

PeTTa-first abstract algorithmic chemistry experiments.

The core chemistry kernel is implemented in PeTTa/MeTTa syntax from the start. Python may be added later only as thin harness/glue for configuration, batch execution, storage, plotting, and filesystem logistics.

## Runtime decision

Version 0.1 targets the locally validated PeTTa runtime:

- PeTTa checkout: `../omegaclaw/repos/PeTTa` in the surrounding research workspace, or any compatible PeTTa checkout via `PETTA_RUNNER`.
- SWI-Prolog: 9.3.x; initial local validation used SWI-Prolog 9.3.36.
- Kernel files: `.metta` under `src/` and `experiments/`.

See `docs/runtime.md` for rationale and reproduction details.

## First smoke test

From this repository:

```bash
scripts/run_exp00.sh
```

This runs `experiments/exp00/smoke.metta`, a deliberately tiny deterministic chemistry spike. It establishes initial molecule/rule/state/candidate/candidate-pool/candidate-cap/event/chamber/metric atom contracts plus a generic bounded binary catalytic transition, candidate applicability checks, nonnegative abundance invariants, chamber-rule-based candidate generation, per-tick candidate caps, and a seed/tick deterministic candidate selector wired into generated chamber ticking before larger stochastic/harness work is added.
